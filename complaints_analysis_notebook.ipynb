# Complaints Analysis

This notebook contains the analysis of complaints data to explore what's driving complaints, focusing on the frequency distributions of the categorical fields, visualization of keywords, and exploring "topics over time".

## Importing Necessary Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

## Load and Preview the Data
The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and the first few rows are displayed to understand the structure of the data.

```python
# Load the data from the CSV file
file_path = '/mnt/data/file-rWwFXZKIqWT4jFXEQBZgBtim'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
data.head()
```
[Render the dataframe here]

## Frequency Distributions
The frequency distributions of various categorical fields such as 'Complaint filed by', 'Complaint type', 'Coverage type', 'Coverage level', 'Complainant type', and 'Finding type' are visualized as bar charts.

```python
# Code to create bar charts for each categorical field
```

## Word Cloud of Keywords
A word cloud is created to visualize the most frequent keywords in the complaints data.

```python
# Code to create a word cloud
```

## Trends of Keywords Over Time
The trends of the top keywords over time are visualized in a line plot to identify any patterns.

```python
# Handle NaN values in 'Keywords' before performing the analysis
data['Keywords'] = data['Keywords'].fillna('')

# Convert 'Received date' to datetime format
data['Received date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Received date'], errors='coerce')
data['Year'] = data['Year'].sort_values().unique()

# Code to calculate and plot the trends of the top keywords over time
```
